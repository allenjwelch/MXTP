### Project Title:     mxtp

##Team Members:    Susan Davenport, Allen Welch, Eddie Rodriguez

##Project Description:
An intuitive application that allows users to create unique playlists, listen to others playlists, and share with friends. 
App includes song playback, album art, and lyrics. Users will be able to save their playlist to a database and recall 
by searching for their name. The page will also display the four most recently added playlists. 


#Pseudocode:
The application will load to a starting page, it will have several mixtape images available to choose from for creating a playlist cover.

Users will be able to give their mixtape a name and save it with an e-mail to firebase.

Users will use a search bar to look through the musixmatch API for tracks. 
 Once they select a track from the search, the app will add it to a playlist, up to 10 tracks.

Once songs are selected, user clicks “Create/ Finish” Button and is presented with final imaging and track list.

There is an image of the final tape chosen with the name of it written on top of the image. The songs will be to the right in table form

Users can share the final product with friends

Using Musixmatch, lyrics for track playing will be shown when play button is hit. 

The app can also search through the youtube API to find videos of the songs they add to the playlist (Video Button beside track).

On the bottom of the first page they can see the most recent mixtapes that others have made.

The app needs to show 4 recent mixtapes saved to firebase.

Can recall previously created playlists by searching database for name or email.
